To-do List
  * Change Text and pictures to liquid based instead of static.
  * Check into why the Navbar items have different heights when the site is horizontally compressed (Change font size as it compresses?).
  * Make the top a header so that it scales with the display width.
  * Change Background since it looks bad at the bottom (image splits).
  * Center Navbar and expand to cover the whole white area.
  * Create template page for most pages.
  * Remove Social Media submenu from contact us tab.
  * Instead of underlined bold text as section headers, use larger text in a different color.
  * Add space between the header and the previous picture on the main page.
  * Alphabatize submenu tabs.
  * 
  * Finish to-do list. :/
